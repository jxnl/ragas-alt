# RAGAS Evaluation Best Practices

This document provides guidance on effectively using the RAGAS evaluation framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Core Evaluation Metrics

Our implementation evaluates RAG systems across four key dimensions:

1. **Faithfulness**: Measures whether the generated answer contains claims supported by the retrieved context
2. **Relevancy**: Assesses how well the answer addresses the original question
3. **Precision**: Evaluates whether the retrieved chunks were useful for answering the question
4. **Recall**: Measures whether all statements in the answer can be attributed to the retrieved context

## Prompt Engineering Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Structured Evaluation**: Use step-by-step instructions to guide the evaluation process
- **Binary Verdicts + Nuance**: Combine binary decisions (supported/not supported) with nuanced assessments
- **Chain of Thought**: Have the model verbalize its reasoning process
- **Evidence Citation**: Always require specific evidence to support judgments
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Break complex evaluations into atomic verification tasks
- **Clear Criteria**: Define explicit criteria for what constitutes a positive or negative evaluation

### For Each Metric

#### Faithfulness Evaluation
- First extract atomic claims, then verify each claim
- Require citation of specific chunks that support each claim
- Apply strict criteria: all aspects of a claim must be verifiable

#### Relevancy Evaluation
- Assess multiple dimensions: topical alignment, completeness, specificity
- Use weighted scoring to combine these dimensions
- Account for special cases like "I don't know" responses appropriately

#### Precision Evaluation
- Evaluate each context chunk independently
- Use Chain of Thought reasoning for each evaluation
- Focus on the information contributed by each chunk

#### Recall Evaluation
- Use fine-grained attribution levels rather than binary judgments
- Account for confidence in attribution assessments
- Weigh explicit support higher than implicit support

## Implementation Tips

### Model Selection

- Use the most capable model available for evaluation
- Consider using different models for generation vs. evaluation
- GPT-4 and Claude models perform particularly well for evaluation tasks

### Context Handling

- Pay attention to chunk boundaries and cross-references
- Include chunk IDs in evaluation to track which chunks contributed
- Consider chunk overlap when measuring precision

### Scoring Methodology

- Use weighted scoring that accounts for confidence and attribution levels
- Consider aggregating scores across multiple examples for reliable benchmarks
- Keep track of both overall scores and per-metric breakdowns

### Evaluation Process

- Use a consistent evaluation protocol across all test cases
- Run evaluations independently for each metric to avoid biasing results
- Keep human reviewers in the loop for calibration

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-generalization**: Ensure claims are tightly linked to specific evidence
- **Lenient evaluation**: Maintain strict standards for what counts as "supported"
- **Context leakage**: Ensure evaluation doesn't use information outside the provided context
- **Lack of nuance**: Binary evaluations can miss important distinctions in quality

## Future Improvements

Consider these areas for advancing your RAG evaluation:

- **Cross-document reasoning**: Evaluate how well the system synthesizes information across documents
- **Temporal consistency**: Check if answers remain valid when context contains time-sensitive information
- **Citation quality**: Measure how well the system attributes information to sources
- **Response coherence**: Evaluate the overall structure and flow of the generated answer
